Software Requirements Specification – Project Management System (rdash.io alternative)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
Build a clean, minimal, and robust project and task management web app (as on rdash.io) with Admin and User (normal) roles, using Angular (TypeScript) for the frontend, PHP as REST backend, and SQLite for data. All logic, authentication and routing must be simple yet secure and performant.

1.2 Audience
This SRS is intended for full-stack developers, frontend (Angular) devs, backend (PHP) devs, designers, and QA.

1.3 Scope
Deployed to a cPanel-accessible server, backend at cyberplatter.com/route.php.

Database file(s) stored at dbo/data/ (SQLite).

All features of rdash.io (project/task assignation, roles, dashboard, media in comments, etc.).

For now: focus on login, role routing, user add, and dashboard features.

2. Overall Description
2.1 User Roles and Flows
Admin:

Can log in

Can add User (with email and password)

Can create Project, assign Users

Can view all users, all tasks, all comments & media

Dashboard shows updates and progress from all users

User (Normal):

Can log in with email/password

Sees only "My Tasks" assigned by Admin

Can update assigned Task status (e.g. In Progress, Done)

Can comment, add photos (jpg, png), add video (mp4) to a Task

Can see their comments/media on their tasks

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Authentication
Simple login form

POST credentials to server (route.php?action=login)

Store session token/JWT (simple session cookie for now is enough)

On success, route to Admin Dashboard or User Dashboard, based on role

3.2 Routing/Views
/login – Login page

/admin – Admin dashboard; redirect if not admin

/user – User dashboard; redirect if not normal user

/user-create – Admin-only, Create user form

/dashboard – Admin/User dashboard view

3.3 User Creation
Admin can open user creation form

Fill: Email, Password, Role (Admin/User)

POST to route.php?action=createUser (Store hash of password, never plaintext)

List of users visible to Admin

3.4 Project and Task Management (summary)
Admin can create Projects; Assign users

Admin can create/assign Tasks, see task status for all users

User can see "My Tasks" only (GET request filters by assigned userId)

User can update Task status (In Progress, Review, Completed)

Both can add comments to Tasks; user can attach photo/video in comment (uploads via multipart to PHP, saved in dbo/data media folder, store URL in comment row)

3.5 Dashboard
Admin Dashboard: Shows all user updates, tasks progress, recent comments/media.

User Dashboard: Shows only their tasks, status, comments, and uploads.

3.6 Media in Comments
File upload (image, video) in /comment form (jpg, png, mp4 only, <10MB)

URL/path referenced in comments table

4. Data Structure (SQLite)
All tables stored in dbo/data directory.

users: id, email, password_hash, role (admin|user)

projects: id, title, description, created_by (user)

tasks: id, project_id, assigned_to (user id), description, status, due_date

comments: id, task_id, author_id (user), comment_text, media_url, created_at

5. Implementation Phases
PHASE 1 (This Prompt – Login, User Roles, User Creation, Dashboard Route)
Backend (PHP: route.php)
/route.php?action=login (POST):

Accept email/password

Validate against users table

Return success, role, and session token/cookie

/route.php?action=createUser (POST):

Check if requester is admin

Insert new user with (hashed password), role, email

Return status

/route.php?action=listUsers (GET):

Check if admin

Return list of users (no password fields)

Session system: Use PHP sessions or generate a JWT (store/admin as cookie)

Directory for DB: dbo/data/app.db (or as provided)

Frontend (Angular)
/login component + auth service (with route guard based on role)

/admin component (lists users, User Creation modal/form)

/user component (shows only user's tasks - just a placeholder for now)

/dashboard (role-based data fetch, just a placeholder for now)

Routing guards to prevent role misnavigation

On login: store token/role in localStorage/session, route to correct dashboard

All HTTP requests point to cyberplatter.com/route.php

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Responsive/spa UI with Angular best practices

Clean REST-like API endpoints

DB & media files protected from direct web access by .htaccess (except APIs)

Passwords always stored hashed (bcrypt recommended, or PHP’s password_hash)

Basic error handling (invalid login, user already exists, etc.)

7. Security
Sessions expire after 24h/no activity

Each API checks session validity and role

File uploads validated for type/size (never allow .php, .js, etc.)
